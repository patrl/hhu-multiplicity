* Part 1

For each of the following:

- Is it a well-formed expression of the simply-typed lambda calculus? If so, what is its type?
- If the formula is well-formed, simplify it as much as possible using beta reduction.
  
N.b., assume the following:

- \(x,y: E\) 
- \(P,Q,X: E \to T\)
- \(R: E \to E \to T\)
- \(a,b : E\)
