This is how to write an example and refer back to it:

#+name: example1
#+begin_exe
\ex If a farmer owns a donkey, he beats it.
#+end_exe

Consider the sentence in ([[example1]]).

Let's try a multipart example.

#+name: example2
#+begin_exe
\ex If a farmer owns a donkey, he doesn't beat it.
#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment xlist
- Here's a sub part.
- Here's another sub part.
#+end_exe

#+name: example3
#+begin_exe
\ex $\lambda x\,.\,x = y$
#+end_exe
