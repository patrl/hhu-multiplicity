* Class description

In this class we'll develop a compositional approach to
plurality using concepts from Boolean algebra. We'll primarily be following Yoad Winter' 2001 book "Flexibility Principles in Boolean Semantics - the Interpretation of Coordination, Plurality, and Scope in Natural Language", chapter by chapter. We'll begin by asking: what is the role of natural language coordination ("and") in forming /pluralities/? Cross-linguistically, many languages use exactly the same coordinator to express both boolean conjunction, and an operation we might call /group-formation/. We'll investigate exactly why this might be. Later in the course, we'll discuss other semantic phenomena which require reference to pluralities, and ramifications for the compositional apparatus. 
  
* Prerequisites

- At least one introductory class in compositional semantics, with
  similar coverage to /Semantics in Generative Grammar/
  [cite:@HeimKratzer1998].
- At least one class covering basic formal methods, i.e., logic (up to first order), and set theory.

* Assessment

** Beteiligungsnachweis

- Regular active participation.
- Do the readings.
  
** Requirements for Abschlussprüfung

- One class presentation (this can be either a reading group style presentation of a paper, or a group discussion of your squib topic).
- A squib (i.e., short research paper, max 12 pages, prefereably 5-10).
  * At least one meeting with me to discuss your squib topic.
  
The etymology of "squib", according to Haj Ross:[fn:1] 

#+begin_quote
WRT the word: I no longer know – my memory is too foggy over the 48 ± years since I started collecting them. I got to MIT in January of 1964; George Lakoff was an assistant professor at Harvard; we both were research assistants in Susumu Kuno’s lab, and we squibbed well and truly on a daily basis. I have asked George whether he knows who came up with the term or not; he says he is positive: I was the one. Could be – I certainly can’t deny responsibility.

At some point I went looking in the OED to see if it contained a meaning like “short note” or anything like that. My wretched memory tells me that yes, there was such a meaning among the many that the OED offered up, but when I went this morning to look again for it for you, not a bit of it. There is one basic meaning, which has to do with with some kind of firework. But one of the citations is

1599 Master Broughtons Lett. 47 Your bookes [are] but squibs, compounds of gunpowder and pisse.

Which I think would be an excellent sentence to have at the beginning of every squib section in each issue of LI.
